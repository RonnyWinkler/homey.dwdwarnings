Be warned of storms and weather events in your city or your district with the reports of the German Weather Service. 

The weather warnings from the German Weather Service DWD are read periodically. The messages about warning areas defined in Homey are evaluated.
The periodic retrieval can be activated/deactivated in the app settings and the retrieval interval can be changed (by default every 15 minutes). 

For each area (Homey device), some summarized data is saved as device attributes, e.g .:
- Number of warnings for the area
- Highest warning level
- Type of warning with the highest warning level

In addition, if warnings occur or if there are changes, all warnings are individually written to the timeline.
An automatic push notification is possible via the settings of the timeline.

All warnings of an area are available as summarized text as a device attribute. This text can be used as a flow tag in order to send it via flow if necessary.
